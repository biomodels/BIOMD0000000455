Metabolic control analysis (MCA) is a biochemical formalism, defining how
variables, such as fluxes and concentrations, depend on network parameters. In
this paper, owing to its limitations, it is shown with three example models
(MODEL1305030000-2) that the algorithm with slight modification can be applied
to all models.

This model is described in the article:

Abstract:

Metabolic control analysis is a biochemical formalism defined by Kacser and
Burns in 1973, and given firm mathematical basis by Reder in 1988. The
algorithm defined by Reder for calculating the control matrices is still used
by software programs today, but is only valid for some biochemical models. We
show that, with slight modification, the algorithm may be applied to all
models.
